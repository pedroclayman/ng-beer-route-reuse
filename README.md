# RouteReuse

```shell
# install dependencies
npm i

# run
ng serve
```
The application runs on http://localhost:4200 once started.

This repository demonstrates how to use a custom `RouteReuseStrategy` in
a bit more "real-world-like" application. You can use the commit history
from step 1 to 12 to follow the development process.
